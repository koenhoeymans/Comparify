Comparify
---------

Probably of very little use to anyone. It is used by [AnyMark][] and [AnyMarkExtra][]
to compare the resulting output with expected results, leaving me full control
over what is and what is not adjusted. Other approaches (e.g. Tidy) did too
many things to correct mistakes that hid real problems.
